Henry Zhu (@left_pad), maintainer of Babel, the Open Source Javascript compiler, joins the mafia. He explains going full time open source independent for the last year, how he pays rent and what he loves/hates about open source. Hope you enjoy another episode of Jess (@jessfraz) and Andrew (@littleidea) tricking people into saying words about stuff.
